# Project Instructions

## Architecture Documentation

This project maintains arc42 architecture documentation in `docs/arc42/` (13 files, one per section).

**Rule:** After completing any GSD phase execution, always update the arc42 documentation by running the arc42-documenter agent targeting `docs/arc42/`. This ensures the architecture docs stay in sync with the codebase.

The agent definition is at `.claude/agents/arc42-documenter.md`.
