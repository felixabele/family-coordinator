# Phase 3 Plan 02: Multi-User Access Control & Commands Summary

**One-liner:** Family whitelist integration with access control gates, command detection (help/cancel), group chat support, and personalized greetings by member name.

## What Was Built

Completed the multi-user support infrastructure by wiring the family whitelist into the message processing pipeline with access control, command shortcuts, and personalized responses.

### Core Components

**1. Shared Help Text Constant (`src/config/constants.ts`)**

- `HELP_TEXT`: Centralized help message used by both command handler and LLM intent
- Avoids duplication (DRY)
- German localization with emoji formatting
- Includes "abbrechen" instruction for conversation reset

**2. Command Detection (`src/signal/listener.ts`)**

- `detectCommand()`: Pre-LLM command detection for help/cancel
- Triggers: `hilfe`, `help`, `?` → help | `abbrechen`, `cancel`, `reset` → cancel
- Returns null for normal messages (proceed to LLM)

**3. Command Handler (`handleCommand()`)**

- Always resets conversation state (clears history)
- No LLM API call needed
- Help: Returns HELP_TEXT
- Cancel: Returns "Alles klar, was kann ich für dich tun?"
- Logs command execution with phone number

**4. Access Control Gate**

- First check in message processing pipeline (before everything else)
- Uses `familyWhitelist.isAllowed(phoneNumber)`
- Rejects unknown senders with polite German message
- Logged as warning for monitoring unauthorized attempts

**5. Non-Text Message Handling**

- Changed from silent skip to polite rejection
- Message: "Ich kann leider nur Textnachrichten verarbeiten."
- Covers images, voice notes, stickers, videos, etc.

**6. Group Chat Support**

- Removed group message filter (was Phase 1 limitation)
- Bot now processes messages in both 1:1 and group chats
- No special handling needed - same pipeline

**7. Personalized Responses**

- `handleIntent()` now accepts optional `memberName` parameter
- Greeting case: "Hey {Name}!" if name available, "Hey!" otherwise
- Member name retrieved via `familyWhitelist.getName(phoneNumber)`

**8. Application Startup Integration (`src/index.ts`)**

- Family config loaded at step 2 (after env validation, before service creation)
- Fail-fast validation: app won't start if `family-members.json` invalid/missing
- Logs member count on successful load
- `familyWhitelist` passed to message listener in deps

## Implementation Details

### Message Processing Order (Updated)

The pipeline now processes messages in this order:

1. Extract envelope data (phone, messageId, text)
2. **Access control** - Reject if not in whitelist
3. **Non-text rejection** - Send polite message if no text
4. Idempotency check - Skip if already processed
5. Mark as processed
6. **Command detection** - Handle help/cancel without LLM
7. Get conversation state
8. Add user message to history
9. Extract intent via LLM
10. Handle intent (with member name for personalization)
11. Send response
12. Add assistant response to history

### Processing Order Rationale

- **Access control first**: Security gate before any processing
- **Commands before LLM**: Save API costs, improve latency
- **Non-text rejection early**: No need to mark as processed if can't handle

### HELP_TEXT Design

```typescript
export const HELP_TEXT = [
  "Ich bin dein Familienkalender-Bot! Das kann ich für dich tun:",
  "",
  '📅 Termine anzeigen — z.B. "Was steht heute an?" oder "Termine diese Woche"',
  '➕ Termine erstellen — z.B. "Zahnarzt am Montag um 10 Uhr"',
  '❌ Termine löschen — z.B. "Lösche den Zahnarzt-Termin"',
  "",
  'Schreib "abbrechen" um neu zu starten.',
].join("\n");
```

- Used by both `handleCommand` and `handleIntent` (help case)
- Centralized in constants.ts for maintainability
- Includes examples for clarity
- Mentions "abbrechen" for discoverability

## Testing Performed

Verified all plan requirements:

1. HELP_TEXT in constants.ts: ✓ Found
2. HELP_TEXT in listener.ts: ✓ 3 occurrences (import, handleCommand, help case)
3. detectCommand: ✓ 2 occurrences (definition + usage)
4. familyWhitelist: ✓ 3 occurrences (import type, interface, usage)
5. handleCommand: ✓ 2 occurrences (definition + usage)
6. clearState: ✓ Called in handleCommand
7. Group filter removed: ✓ No "Skipping group" messages
8. Non-text rejection: ✓ "Textnachrichten" message present
9. abbrechen: ✓ In detectCommand function
10. TypeScript compiles: ✓ No errors

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Integration Points

**Phase 3 Multi-User Success Criteria:**

1. ✅ Multiple family members can interact (whitelist-based access)
2. ✅ Bot identifies which family member sent each message (phone → name lookup)
3. ✅ User can reset stuck conversations (help/cancel commands)
4. ✅ Conversation context times out after 30 min (already implemented in Phase 1)

**Downstream Usage:**

- Unknown sender receives rejection message
- Family members get personalized greetings
- Commands bypass LLM for instant response
- Group chats work seamlessly
- Non-text messages handled gracefully

**Security Boundary:**

The `familyWhitelist.isAllowed()` check acts as the security gate. All unauthorized messages are rejected with a polite message - no further processing, no LLM calls, no database writes (except idempotency mark).

## Self-Check: PASSED

### Modified Files

```bash
FOUND: src/config/constants.ts (HELP_TEXT constant added)
FOUND: src/signal/listener.ts (access control, commands, personalization)
FOUND: src/index.ts (whitelist loading at startup)
```

### Commits

```bash
FOUND: 6cb6171 (feat(03-02): add access control, command detection, and personalized responses)
FOUND: fdc7564 (feat(03-02): wire family whitelist into application startup)
```

### Verification

All verification checks passed:

- HELP_TEXT constant created and used in 3 places
- detectCommand and handleCommand implemented
- familyWhitelist integrated into MessageListenerDeps
- clearState called on commands
- Group filter removed
- Non-text rejection with polite message
- TypeScript compilation successful
- Startup loads family config before Signal connection

All artifacts verified successfully.
